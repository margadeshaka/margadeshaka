This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 6 of the ChakraVision project, which focuses on deployment and CI/CD setup.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Deployment Configuration

#### Vercel Deployment
- Created `vercel.json` with configuration for Next.js deployment
- Set up environment variables in the configuration
- Configured routing for the application

#### Azure Static Web Apps Deployment
- Created GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps.yml`
- Configured build and deployment settings
- Set up environment variables for the deployment

### 2. Environment Variables
- Updated `next.config.js` to handle environment variables
- Created `.env.example` as a template for environment variables
- Documented required environment variables:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID`
  - `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN`

### 3. Custom Domain & SSL
- Documented the process for setting up custom domains and SSL in `docs/deployment.md`
- For Vercel: Using the Vercel dashboard
- For Azure: Using the Azure Portal

### 4. Terraform Scripts for Azure Resource Automation
- Created Terraform scripts in the `terraform` directory
- Configured resources:
  - Azure Resource Group
  - Azure Static Web App
  - Application Insights for monitoring
  - Custom domain configuration
- Created comprehensive documentation in `terraform/README.md`

### 5. Analytics for User Engagement
- Created `Analytics.tsx` component that supports:
  - Google Analytics
  - Azure Application Insights
- Added the component to the application layout
- Added `@microsoft/applicationinsights-web` dependency
- Configured analytics to track page views and user interactions

## Documentation
- Created `docs/deployment.md` with detailed deployment instructions
- Created `terraform/README.md` with instructions for using Terraform scripts
- Updated `docs/tasks.md` to mark Phase 6 tasks as completed

## How to Deploy

### Vercel Deployment
1. Push your code to a Git repository
2. Connect the repository to Vercel
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy the application
5. Set up a custom domain (optional)

### Azure Static Web Apps Deployment
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Create an Azure Static Web App in the Azure Portal
3. Connect it to your GitHub repository
4. Configure environment variables
5. Set up a custom domain (optional)

### Using Terraform for Azure Deployment
1. Install Terraform and Azure CLI
2. Configure your Azure credentials
3. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file with your configuration
4. Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`
5. Configure DNS for your custom domain

## Next Steps
- Test the deployment process
- Set up monitoring and alerts
- Implement continuous integration with automated testing
- Consider implementing a staging environment for testing before production
