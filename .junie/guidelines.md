# 🔱 ChakraVision – 3D Sudarshan Chakra Interactive Web Experience

A beautiful interactive web application built with **Next.js** and **Three.js**, centered around a 3D **Sudarshan Chakra**, inspired by authentic Hindu scriptures. As the user scrolls, the chakra highlights different points and reveals spiritual insights or dialog panels.

## 📐 Project Architecture

### ⚙ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **3D Engine**: [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) via `@react-three/fiber`
- **3D Model Loader**: `@react-three/drei` (`useGLTF`)
- **Scroll-based Animation**: `GSAP` + `ScrollTrigger` or `react-intersection-observer`
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules
- **Deployment**: Vercel / Azure Static Web App
- **Authentication (optional)**: Azure AD B2C / MSAL.js

🧠 Chakra Model Reference

Design the Sudarshan Chakra based on:
	•	Vishnu Purana: Describes it as a blazing disc with 108 serrated spokes.
	•	Mahabharata: Mentions it as Lord Vishnu’s divine weapon spinning faster than light.
	•	Padma Purana: Speaks of its golden body, center of light, and fire-rimmed circumference.

Use this to create a .glb 3D model in Blender and export to /public/models.

⸻

🔄 Scroll Interaction Design
	•	Use GSAP ScrollTrigger or a custom useScrollPosition hook
	•	Move camera along 3D path using lerp or ref.current.position.set(...)
	•	At each scroll milestone, update the dialog on screen

⸻
