# Phase 5 Implementation: Advanced Features

This document describes the implementation of Phase 5 features for the Sudarshan Chakra 3D Interactive App.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Background Mantra Audio

- Added an `AudioPlayer` component that plays background mantra audio
- Implemented a toggle button to play/pause the audio
- Audio state is managed in the ChakraContext
- Audio file should be placed at `/public/audio/om-mantra.mp3`

### 2. Multi-language Support

- Added a `LanguageContext` to manage language state (English, Sanskrit, Hindi)
- Created a `LanguageSelector` component to switch between languages
- Updated the chakraPoints.json file to include translations for all content
- All UI text is now translatable using the `t` function

### 3. Mobile Gesture Support

- Added swipe gestures for navigation using react-swipeable
- Implemented swipe up/down to navigate between chakra points
- Added mobile navigation indicators at the bottom of the screen
- Ensured smooth scrolling when navigating between points

### 4. Login System

- Implemented a simplified login system with mock authentication
- Added a `LoginButton` component that shows login/logout buttons
- User authentication state is managed in the ChakraContext
- Can be extended to use Azure AD B2C / MSAL.js for real authentication

### 5. User Progress Tracking

- Added tracking of which chakra points the user has viewed
- Progress is saved to localStorage and persists between sessions
- The ChakraContext provides functions to unlock points and check progress

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Audio Player**: Click the audio button in the bottom right to play/pause the mantra audio
2. **Language Selector**: Use the language buttons in the top right to switch between English, Sanskrit, and Hindi
3. **Mobile Gestures**: On mobile or touch devices, swipe up/down to navigate between chakra points
4. **Login System**: Click the login button in the top left to simulate logging in/out
5. **Progress Tracking**: As you view different chakra points, your progress is automatically saved

## Next Steps

- Add actual audio file for the mantra
- Implement real authentication with Azure AD B2C / MSAL.js
- Proceed to Phase 6: Deployment & CI/CD
