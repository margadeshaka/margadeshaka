# Sudarshan Chakra 3D Interactive App - Improvement Tasks

This document contains a phase-wise task list for developing a Next.js Sudarshan Chakra 3D interactive app, from initial setup to deployment.

## üöÄ Phase 1: Project Setup & Boilerplate

**Objective**: Set up a working Next.js app with 3D rendering support

- [ ] Initialize Next.js app with App Router
- [ ] Install core dependencies:
  - [ ] @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, three
  - [ ] gsap, react-intersection-observer (for scroll control)
  - [ ] tailwindcss (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Configure global styles and layout
- [ ] Create basic page layout with full-screen 3D canvas
- [ ] Add dark background or cosmic-themed gradient

## üåê Phase 2: Sudarshan Chakra 3D Integration

**Objective**: Integrate authentic 3D model of Sudarshan Chakra

- [ ] Research Hindu scripture references for Sudarshan Chakra
- [ ] Create or commission accurate 3D model (.glb format)
- [ ] Load 3D model using useGLTF from @react-three/drei
- [ ] Center model in canvas and rotate slowly by default
- [ ] Ensure 3D model is responsive across screen sizes

## üß† Phase 3: Scroll-Based Camera & Info Mapping

**Objective**: Sync scroll events with camera + chakra pointer + UI content

- [x] Set up scroll sections using ScrollTrigger or a custom scroll observer
- [x] Create camera path movement logic using Three.js animation/lerp
- [x] Create JSON config for chakra points:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Divine Origin",
      "description": "The Sudarshan Chakra was forged by Vishwakarma, the divine architect, from the dust of the sun.",
      "position": "right",
      "cameraPosition": [5, 0, 8]
    },
    ...
  ]
  ```
- [x] Move camera to point on scroll
- [x] Display left/right dialog box with title and content

## üé® Phase 4: UI & Visual Polish

**Objective**: Add aesthetic UI and animation polish

- [x] Style dialog box with Tailwind or CSS modules
- [x] Animate dialog fade-in/out based on scroll
- [x] Add glow effect or light around chakra
- [x] Cosmic background with subtle motion (optional)
- [x] Optional: Add Sanskrit/Hindi subtitles

## üîê Phase 5: Advanced Features (Optional)

**Objective**: Make app spiritually rich and interactive

- [x] Add background mantra audio or toggle music
- [x] Add multi-language toggle (Sanskrit, Hindi, English)
- [x] Add mobile gesture support for navigation
- [x] Add login system via Azure AD B2C / MSAL.js
- [x] Save user progress / chakra points unlocked

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Phase 6: Deployment & CI/CD

**Objective**: Deploy app and ensure stable release flow

- [x] Prepare build (npm run build)
- [x] Set up Azure Static Web App or Vercel
- [x] Set environment variables if any
- [x] Add custom domain & SSL
- [x] Optional: Terraform scripts for Azure resource automation
- [x] Optional: Monitor user engagement via analytics

## üìò Final Checklist

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| [x] Chakra 3D Model Integrated | Completed |
| [x] Scroll-based Info Display | Completed |
| [x] Responsive Cosmic Design | Completed |
| [x] Vedic Chakra Mapping | Completed |
| [x] Deployment to Cloud | Completed |

## üß† Architectural Improvements

- [ ] Implement proper state management (Context API or Redux)
- [ ] Create reusable components for UI elements
- [ ] Optimize 3D model loading with suspense and fallbacks
- [ ] Implement error boundaries for robust error handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging system

## üíª Code-Level Improvements

- [ ] Establish consistent code style with ESLint and Prettier
- [ ] Add TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- [ ] Implement unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for 3D rendering
- [ ] Create documentation for component API
- [ ] Optimize bundle size with code splitting
