# Sudarshan Chakra 3D Model

This directory is where you should place the 3D model file for the Sudarshan Chakra.

## Expected File

- `sudarshan-chakra.glb` - The main 3D model file in GLB format

## Model Requirements

Design the Sudarshan Chakra based on authentic Hindu scriptures:

1. **Vishnu Purana**: Describes it as a blazing disc with 108 serrated spokes.
2. **Mahabharata**: Mentions it as Lord Vishnu's divine weapon spinning faster than light.
3. **Padma Purana**: Speaks of its golden body, center of light, and fire-rimmed circumference.

## Creating the Model

You can create this model using:
- Blender (recommended)
- Maya
- 3D Studio Max
- Or any other 3D modeling software that can export to GLB format

## Alternative Sources

If you don't have 3D modeling skills, you can:
1. Commission a 3D artist to create the model
2. Find a suitable model on platforms like Sketchfab or TurboSquid (ensure proper licensing)

## Optimization Tips

For web performance:
- Keep the polygon count under 50,000 for smooth performance
- Use texture maps instead of complex geometry where possible
- Ensure the model is properly centered at origin (0,0,0)
- Apply compression to textures
- Keep the file size under 5MB if possible
